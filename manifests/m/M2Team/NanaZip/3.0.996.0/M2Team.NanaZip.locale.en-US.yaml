ReleaseNotes: "I'm excited to announce that we've released the NanaZip 3.0 which is now available for download. I think users will love the changes from this version. Here are some screenshots for the NanaZip 3.0 main window.Light ModeDark ModeI don't want to say anything for this release except the following notices because the screenshots can mention a lot.NanaZip will be not only a simple 7-Zip fork anymore, the relationship between NanaZip and 7-Zip is more like Chromium and WebKit because I think most of the changes I will do for NanaZip have no chance of being accepted by Igor Pavlov. But NanaZip will still keep the Core Library and Self Extracting Executables implementation synchronized to the latest 7-Zip mainline implementation. This is why I rewrote and split the implementation of the Core Library and the Self Extracting Executable to the separate NanaZip.Core project. The other parts will be modernized as soon as possible. Also, I think I will try to make the modernized 7-Zip Plugin SDK with 100% C++/WinRT style in the future because Igor Pavlov changes a lot in every release, and we need a more simplified way to develop plugins for 7-Zip and NanaZip.NanaZip has introduced the Preinstall Support. Read #398 for more information.NanaZip provides a $99.99 Sponsor Edition addon to the Microsoft Store to attract more sponsors and contributors. It's free for NanaZip source code repository contributors and NanaZip sponsors who sponsored before March 30, 2024. The only difference for NanaZip Sponsor Edition is showing \"❤️ Appreciate your sponsorship ❤️\" button instead of \"☕ Sponsor NanaZip ☕\" button in the NanaZip's toolbar like the Visual Studio administrator mode. I hope every NanaZip user is happier than before. Here are some imaginative examples. Read  for more information.NanaZip 3.0 and onwards will have two distribution flavors called NanaZip and NanaZip Classic. So, the 32-bit x86 support for the NanaZip packaged version is removed because supported 32-bit x86 Windows versions don't support running on 32-bit only x86 processors. But NanaZip 3.0 does not have the Classic flavor yet because it's not ready. Although we only chose Windows as the major platform for the NanaZip project supported because Windows has maintained a good and proven ABI and compatibility, and stands out in the whole history. But we also care about the non-Windows platform. Read  and  for more information.Finally, I want to say sorry to people who want to change the icons and toolbar in the NanaZip main window. Recently, the NanaZip main window's menu bar and toolbar have been replaced by the new XAML-based toolbar, and it uses font icons from Segoe MDL2 Assets.Release Notes\n- Notes\n    - NanaZip 3.0 and onwards will have two distribution flavors called NanaZip and NanaZip Classic.
